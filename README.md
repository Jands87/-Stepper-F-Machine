This is a NEMA 23 driven stepper motor driven linear actuator coupled to a ball-screw thread for a back and forth motion.
Made in a 40x40 aluminium box tube. The ball screw is supported by an 8mm bearing at the motor end.
A 19mm round hollow tube is mounted to a ballscrew-nut on the ball screw, this is stopped from rotating by anti-rotation block with a tight tolerance inside the box tube.
Support is given to the 19mm tube by a nylon bushing at the end of the box tube.
